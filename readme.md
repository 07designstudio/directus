## Testing Directus

### Requirements

* Apache HTTP Server
* MySQL Server
* PHP >5.2
* Git
* Composer

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Setup a development enviroment
You will need to setup a local *AMP enviroment (Apache, MySQL and PHP) in order to test Directus. *AMP packages can be found for different platforms:

* [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html) for Mac OS
* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows
* [LAMP](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) for Linux

#### Step 2: Install git
You will need Git to keep your test version of Directus up to date. Unless you already have Git installed, you can download it from [here](http://git-scm.com/).

#### Step 3: Pull down Directus from github
Create a directory named "directus" in the www root. Next, open the directory in the terminal and type:

```
$ git init
$ git clone https://github.com/RNGR/directus6
```
#### Step 4: Install dependencies
Directus uses composer to handle its php dependencies. Go to the `directus/api/` folder and install composer:

```
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Then install the dependencies by executing:

```
$ php composer.phar install
```

#### Step 5: Setup the database
The AMP-packages listed above all include Phpmyadmin. The following three steps need to be completed in order to setup the database

1. Create the database
   1. Databases -> Create Database
   2. Type *directus* as name and select *utf8_general_ci* as Collation.
2. Create a user
   1. Once you've created the database it will be visible in the left column â€“ open it by clicking it.
   2. Privileges -> Add user
   3. Fill in *username* and *password*. Leave the other fields as defaults.
3. Import the database schema
   1. Import->File to Import->Choose file
   2. Open directus/directus.sql
   3. Press Go

#### Step 6: Setup Directus
Open `directus/api/config_sample.php` Add the database username and password from Step 5 to *DB_USER* and *DB_PASSWORD*. Save the file as ```directus/api/config.php```

```
define('DB_USER', 		'myusername');
define('DB_PASSWORD',	'mypassword');
```
#### Step 7: Setup Files Uploads
This requires configuring your Storage Adapters. Currently the best way to do this is to manually edit the `directus_storage_adapters` table using a SQL client.

By default, `directus.sql` should contain two storage adapters out of the box, with the `DEFAULT` and `THUMBNAIL` roles, both using the `FileSystemAdapter` (meaning these will map to your local hard drive).

Simply define the `destination` (absolute path) and `url` (equivalent URL to the same directory) parameters of each of these records. For example, using a MAMP setup, you might define them this way:

```
UPDATE  `directus_storage_adapters` SET  `destination` =  '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/directus-media/', `url` = 'http://localhost:8888/directus-media/' WHERE  `directus_storage_adapters`.`id` = 1;
UPDATE  `directus_storage_adapters` SET  `destination` =  '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/directus-media-thumbnails/', `url` = 'http://localhost:8888/directus-media-thumbnails/' WHERE  `directus_storage_adapters`.`id` = 2;
```

#### Step 8: Done!
Open directus by navigating to the path *directus* in your local host. Log in using the default user *admin@getdirectus.com* and password *admin*

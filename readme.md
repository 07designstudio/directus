Directus
====================

Welcome to Directus, a free and open source content management framework written in Backbone.js that provides a feature-rich environment for rapid development and management of custom SQL database solutions. Directus makes no assumptions about how you should architect your schema â€“ giving you the freedom to tailor the database to your specific project needs and provide an intuitive, one-to-one interface to your users. And instead of encompassing your entire project, Directus focuses on a lightweight core suite designed to integrate with the frameworks already in your workflow.
